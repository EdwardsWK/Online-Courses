# freeCodeCamp Projects

This repository is a reference repository for myself to refer back to if necessary. It contains the exercises that I did whilst following freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Course.

Anyone can use the code contained within, although beware that because it's done as part of FCC, some items may be copyrighted but, where there is no applicable copyright, it will be explicitly stated.

Also please note that there are varying ways to do different aspects within these projects and the code is just the way I choice to do it, you may want to research other ways and decide which you find more efficient or better for yourself.
